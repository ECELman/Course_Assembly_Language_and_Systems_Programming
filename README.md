      作業二 :
      1. Write an assembler problem to exchange the values of arraryD as 4,3,2,1
         .data
         arrayD DWORD 1,2,3,4
      
      2. Write a program that calculates the following expression, A = (A+B) – (C+D). Assign integer
         values to the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX. The value of A, B, C, and D can be determined by yourself.
         
      作業三 :
      Using the String Reverse program as a starting point.
      • #1: Modify the program so the user can input a string containing between 1 and 50 characters.
      • #2: Modify the program so it inputs a list of 32-bit integers from the user, and then displays the
            integers in reverse order.
            
      作業四 ;
      1. Write an assembler problem to implement bubble sort algorithm to sort the following array.
          .data
          array DWORD 3,2,4,1,5
      2. Write a program that displays single character ‘X’ in all possible combination of foreground and
         background colors (16x16=256). The color are numbered from 0 to 15, so you can use a nested loop to  
         generate all possible combinations. The result is shown in the left figure
